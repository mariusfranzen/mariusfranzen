[RealBridgeAppTestPrism](https://github.com/mariusfranzen/RealbridgeApptestPrism) - I made this project when I applied for a job at Realbridge. It's a simple multi-platform application made in C# using the .NET framework, Xamarin and prism. (Complete!)

[Dual Monitor Image Viewer](https://github.com/mariusfranzen/DualMonitorImageViewer) - My first project that was actually gonna be used by someone other than me! It's a pretty simple application. You have like a controll center on your primary screen, where you can controll what images are shown on your other screen. It's meant to be used in like conferences and similar things. I threw it all together in just one day, so the code is quite ugly, but it works! (Complete!)

[Project IMVI](https://github.com/mariusfranzen/Project-Imvi/tree/dev) - This was meant to be a image and video viewer, and a proper successor to the above project. I worked on it after highschool and before my full stack education, mostly with the purpose to learn .NET's WPF and MVVM. (Abandoned)

[Forum Prototype](https://github.com/mariusfranzen/forumprototype/commits/master) - Back in 2019 when I wanted to learn PHP. It was a pretty fun project for a newbie, and it actually sort of worked! (Complete-ish)
